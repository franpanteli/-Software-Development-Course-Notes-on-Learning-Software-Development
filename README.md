# -Software-Development-Course-Notes-on-Learning-Software-Development
This repository contains my notes on the LinkedIn Learning pathway called 'Become a Software Developer'. This is a selection of 11 video courses on various aspects of software development - intended to be taken together to provide a holistic view of software development.  These notes were written with the intent of publishing them as a reference resource. 

The CSS course notes in this repository were written in conjunction with the project for its course, which was completed in a separate repository (CSS-Feynman-Portfolio-Project). 

This is a list of the various files in this repository and a description of the associated course and instructor name: 
* Course Title: Programming Foundations: Web Security
  *  Description: Learn about the most important security concerns when developing websites, and what you can do to keep your servers, software, and data safe from harm. Instructor Kevin Skoglund explains what motivates hackers and their most common methods of attacks, and then details the techniques and mindset needed to craft solutions for these web security challenges. Learn the eight fundamental principles that underlie all security efforts, the importance of filtering input and controlling output, and how to defend against the most common types of attack. This course is essential for developers who want to secure their websites, and for anyone else who wants to learn more about web security.
