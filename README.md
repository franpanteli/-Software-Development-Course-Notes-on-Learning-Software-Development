# -Software-Development-Course-Notes-on-Learning-Software-Development
This repository contains my notes on the LinkedIn Learning pathway called 'Become a Software Developer'. This is a selection of 11 video courses on various aspects of software development - intended to be taken together to provide a holistic view of software development.  These notes were written with the intent of publishing them as a reference resource. 

The CSS course notes in this repository were written in conjunction with the project for its course, which was completed in a separate repository (CSS-Feynman-Portfolio-Project). 

This is a list of the various files in this repository and a description of the associated course:
